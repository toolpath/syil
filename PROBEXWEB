(PROBEXWEB)
(Description: Probe a web in X from left to right)
(Initial Coding: Justin Gray)
(Modified 1/14/2024: Joshua Smith)
(Simplified WCS extended number math, added probe error checking, added probe inspection report)
(#1 is the work coordinate system to store offsets in)
(#2 is the expected length of the web in the x direction)
(#3 is the Z drop height)
(#17 turns on inspection report on/off: 0 leaves it off (default); 1 turns it on )
