(PROBEBORE)
(Description: Probe a bore in X and Y)
(Initial Coding: Justin Gray)
(Modified 1/14/2024: Joshua Smith)
(Simplified WCS extended number math, added probe error checking, added probe inspection report)
(#1 is the work coordinate system to store offsets in)
(#2 is the expected DIAMETER)
(#9 print results enabled by fusion360)
(#17 turns on inspection report on/off: 0 leaves it off (default); 1 turns it on )
(#19 oversize tolorance)
(#20 enable oversize check)

 (calling our slot macros the first time centers probe)
 G65 "PROBEXSLOT" A#1 B#2 I#9 Q0 R#18 S#19
 G65 "PROBEYSLOT" A#1 B#2 I#9 Q0 R#18 S#19

 (calling our slot macros a second time gives an accurate inspection)
 G65 "PROBEXSLOT" A#1 B#2 I#9 Q0 R#18 S#19
 G65 "PROBEYSLOT" A#1 B#2 I#9 Q0 R#18 S#19

(average Diameter calculation)
(@999 and @998 are set in the web macros)
@997 = [@998 + @999]/2

(simple inspection reporting)
IF[#17>0]
 MENU_ADD["Part Diameter In X: @998",""]; 
 MENU_ADD["Part Diameter In Y: @999",""];
 MENU_ADD["AVG Diameter: @997",""];  (THE WORD AVERAGE IS TO LONG FOR THE MENU)
 MENU["INSPECTION REPORT","RESULTS","",1];
