(PROBEY)
(Description: Probe in Y from the front or back)
(Initial Coding: Justin Gray)
(Modified 1/14/2024: Joshua Smith)
(Simplified WCS extended number math, added probe error checking, added probe distance argument)
(Argument A -> #1 is the work coordinate system to store offsets in. The format for extended G54 offsets would be a period followed by the offset(G54.5))
(Argument B -> #2 is the desired probing distance. Enter a positive value to probe the front and a negative value to probe the back)

(load probe config)
G65 "PROBECONFIG"

(important local variables)
#111 = @104               (FAST PROBE SPEED PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)
#112 = @105               (SLOW PROBE SPEED PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)
#105 = @102               (TOOL RADIUS PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)
#108 = @108*[#2/ABS[#2]]  (PROBE BACKOFF DISTANCE PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO * the sign(+1 or -1) of probe distance)

(CALCULATE EXTENDED WCS NUMBER)
(FIX removes any decimal value)
#114 = [[#1 - FIX[#1]] * 10]


(Probe X the desired distance and at fast feed)
