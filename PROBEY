//PROBEY
//Description: Probe in Y from the front or back
//Initial Coding: Justin Gray
//Modified 1/14/2024: Joshua Smith
//Simplified WCS extended number math, added probe error checking, added probe distance argument
//Argument A -> #1 is the work coordinate system to store offsets in. The format for extended G54 offsets would be a period followed by the offset G54.5
//Argument B -> #2 is the desired probing distance. Enter a positive value to probe the front and a negative value to probe the back
//Argument I -> #9 print results enabled by fusion360

//load probe config
