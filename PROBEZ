(PROBEZ)
(Description: Probe in Z from the above stock)
(Initial Coding: Justin Gray)
(Modified 1/14/2024: Joshua Smith)
(Simplified WCS extended number math, added probe error checking, added probe distance argument,removed air blast)
(Argument A -> #1 is the work coordinate system to store offsets in. The format for extended G54 offsets would be a period followed by the offset(G54.5))
(Argument B -> #2 is the desired probing distance and should be negative)

(load probe config)
G65 "PROBECONFIG"

(important local variables)
#111 = @104             (FAST PROBE SPEED PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)
#112 = @105             (SLOW PROBE SPEED PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)
#105 = @107             (TOOL LENGTH PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)
#108 = @108             (PROBE BACKOFF DISTANCE PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)

(CALCULATE EXTENDED WCS NUMBER)
(FIX removes any decimal value)
#114 = [[#1 - FIX[#1]] * 10]
