(CALIBRATEDIAMETER)
(Description: Calibrate the Diameter of the probe using a ring guage)
(Initial coding 1/14/2024: Joshua Smith)
(Your probe must be concentric and you must use a ring guage!!!!!!!!!!)
(#1 is the expected DIAMETER of the artifact)

(load probe config)
G65 "PROBECONFIG"

(important local variables)
#100 = @100             (TOOL NUMBER PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)

(Make sure diameter is zero when calibrating)
W_TOOL_DATA[0,#100,3,0]    (store tool diameter)

(calling our slot macros the first time centers probe)
G65 "PROBEXSLOT" B#1 Q0 
G65 "PROBEYSLOT" B#1 Q0 


(calling our slot macros a second time gives an accurate inspection)
G65 "PROBEXSLOT" B#1 Q0 
G65 "PROBEYSLOT" B#1 Q0

(average Diameter calculation)
(@999 and @998 are set in the slot macros)
(this could be improved by keeping track of both X and Y diameters and controling probe orientation)
#131 = @998                   (measured ring guage diameter in x)
#132 = @999                   (measured ring guage diameter in y)
#133 = #1-#131                (error in x)
#134 = #1-#132                (error in y)
#135 = ABS[#133 + #134]/2     (average error)
W_TOOL_DATA[0,#100,3,#135]    (store tool diameter)
